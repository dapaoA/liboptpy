\section{Introduction}
Optimal Transport (OT) has a long history in mathematics and prevailed recently due to its important role in measuring the distance between histograms in the Machine Learning community. It outperforms the traditional method in many fields like domain adaptation \cite{7586038}, generative model\cite{arjovsky2017wasserstein}, graph machine learning and natural language processing. Its popularity is attributed to the introduction of the Sinkhorn algorithm to the entropic optimal transport problem. which improve the computational speed of OT problem from $\Theta (n^3)$ to $\Theta (n^2)$. However, Optimal transport problem can only deal with balanced samples, which limits its application in the various data structures. Unbalanced Optimal Transport (UOT) problem has been promoted to deal with the drawback. Except for the traditional Sinkhorn method, UOT can be solved with other method like MM  for primal problem and Lagrange method for dual problem. UOT problem has a similar structure with many other famous problems like Non-negative Matrix Factorization and Lasso problem, which encourage the researchers to use the abundant results in these field to improve it.

Screening is a famous method in Lasso problem, the$L_1$ penalize function cause a sparse solution for lasso problem, which constrains many elements of solution equal to zero. The large scale optimization problem suffers from the computational process for manipulating on these zeros elements. \cite{} invented a technique called safe screening, which could theoretically judeg whether the elements in solution equal to zero. It freeze the identified elements before computation and save computational time. Many new methods have been promoted to revise the method, \cite{} invented a dynamic screening to dynamically screening out zeros elements, and there are many paper tries to improve it.  
Fortunately, the OT function in UOT problem has the same effectiveness as $L_1$ in lasso and cause a sparse solution. We believe that this method could be applied on UOT problem

\textbf{Contribution}: We systematically provide the framework for Screening method on UOT problem. We give the correct projection method for UOT screening, which is better than the Lasso one. We also edit the constraints construtioin method for the specific sparse structure of UOT problems and benefits from it.
