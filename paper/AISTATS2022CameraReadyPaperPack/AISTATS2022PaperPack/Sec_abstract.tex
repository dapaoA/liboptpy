This paper promote a dynamic screening framework for Unbalanced Optimal Transport (UOT) problem. Recently, researchers connected the UOT problem with Lasso problem, which encourage us to apply the common speeding up method screening on the UOT problem. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the screening method and propose a better improvement to it based on the unique structure of the UOT problem. We constructed several experiments on the problem and they indicate that...
