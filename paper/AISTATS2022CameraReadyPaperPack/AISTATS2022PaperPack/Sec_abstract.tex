This paper applies dynamic screening framework on the Unbalanced Optimal Transport (UOT) problem. Recently, researchers connected the UOT problem with Lasso problem, which encourage us to combine the widely used technique in Lasso problem, Screening, onto the UOT problem. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the screening method for UOT and propose improvements based on the unique structure of the UOT problem. We constructed several experiments problem and they indicate that...
