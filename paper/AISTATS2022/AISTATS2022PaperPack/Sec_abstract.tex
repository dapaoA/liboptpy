The Safe Screening technique saves computational time by freezing the zero elements in the sparse solution of the Lasso problem. Recently, researchers have linked the UOT problem to the Lasso problem. In this paper, we apply the newest Dynamic Screening framework to the $L_2$ penalized Unbalanced Optimal Transport (UOT) problem. We firstly apply the Screening method onto the UOT problem. We find out that the specific structure for the UOT problem allows it to get better screening results than the Lasso problem. We propose the new Dynamic Screening algorithm and demonstrate its extraordinary effectiveness and potential to benefit from the unique structure of the UOT problem, our algorithm substantially improves the screening efficiency compared to the ordinary Lasso algorithm without significantly increasing on the computational complexity. We demonstrate the advantages of the algorithm through some experiments on the Gaussian distributions and the MNIST dataset.
