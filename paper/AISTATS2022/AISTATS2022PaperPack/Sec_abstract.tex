Safe Screening is a famous technique on Lasso problem by frezzing the zero elements in the solution. Recently, researchers have linked the UOT problem to the Lasso problem. In this paper, we applies the the newest dynamic screening framework on the $L_2$ penalized Unbalanced Optimal Transport (UOT) problem. We proposed new projection and feasible area construction method for UOT problem and demonstrate its extraordinary effectiveness. Benefiting from the unique structure of the UOT problem, our proposed improved algorithm substantially improves the screening efficiency compared to the ordinary Lasso algorithm without significantly increasing the computational complexity. We demonstrate the advantages of the algorithm through some constructed experiments on Gaussian model and MNIST dataset.
