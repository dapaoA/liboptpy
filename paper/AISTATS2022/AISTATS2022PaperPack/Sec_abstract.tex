The Safe Screening technique saves computational time by freezing the zero elements in the sparse solution of the Lasso problem. Recently, researchers have linked the UOT problem to the Lasso problem. In this paper, we apply the newest Dynamic Screening framework to the $L_2$ penalized Unbalanced Optimal Transport (UOT) problem. We proposed a new projection method and a feasible area construction method for Screening on the UOT problem and demonstrate its extraordinary effectiveness and potential to benefit from the unique structure of the UOT problem, our algorithm substantially improves the screening efficiency compared to the ordinary Lasso algorithm without significantly increasing on the computational complexity. We demonstrate the advantages of the algorithm through some experiments on the Gaussian distributions and the MNIST dataset.
