@article{Liero:2018wo,
	abstract = {We develop a full theory for the new class of Optimal Entropy-Transport problems between nonnegative and finite Radon measures in general topological spaces. These problems arise quite naturally by relaxing the marginal constraints typical of Optimal Transport problems: given a pair of finite measures (with possibly different total mass), one looks for minimizers of the sum of a linear transport functional and two convex entropy functionals, which quantify in some way the deviation of the marginals of the transport plan from the assigned measures. As a powerful application of this theory, we study the particular case of Logarithmic Entropy-Transport problems and introduce the new Hellinger--Kantorovich distance between measures in metric spaces. The striking connection between these two seemingly far topics allows for a deep analysis of the geometric properties of the new geodesic distance, which lies somehow between the well-known Hellinger--Kakutani and Kantorovich--Wasserstein distances.},

@article{Schiebinger_CELL_2019,
	abstract = {Summary
Understanding the molecular programs that guide differentiation during development is a major challenge. Here, we introduce Waddington-OT, an approach for studying developmental time courses to infer ancestor-descendant fates and model the regulatory programs that underlie them. We apply the method to reconstruct the landscape of reprogramming from 315,000 single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) profiles, collected at half-day intervals across 18 days. The results reveal a wider range of developmental programs than previously characterized. Cells gradually adopt either a terminal stromal state or a mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition state. The latter gives rise to populations related to pluripotent, extra-embryonic, and neural cells, with each harboring multiple finer subpopulations. The analysis predicts transcription factors and paracrine signals that affect fates and experiments validate that the TF Obox6 and the cytokine GDF9 enhance reprogramming efficiency. Our approach sheds light on the process and outcome of reprogramming and provides a framework applicable to diverse temporal processes in biology.},

	abstract = {Sequence-to-sequence models are commonly trained via maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). However, standard MLE training considers a word-level objective, predicting the next word given the previous ground-truth partial sentence. This procedure focuses on modeling local syntactic patterns, and may fail to capture long-range semantic structure. We present a novel solution to alleviate these issues. Our approach imposes global sequence-level guidance via new supervision based on optimal transport, enabling the overall characterization and preservation of semantic features. We further show that this method can be understood as a Wasserstein gradient flow trying to match our model to the ground truth sequence distribution. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the utility of the proposed approach, showing consistent improvements over a wide variety of NLP tasks, including machine translation, abstractive text summarization, and image captioning.},

	abstract = {Given compactly supported 0 ≤ f, g ∈ L¹(ℝ n ), the problem of transporting a fraction m ≤ min{∥ f ∥ L 1 , ∥ g ∥ L 1 } of the mass of f onto g as cheaply as possible is considered, where cost per unit mass transported is given by a cost function c, typically quadratic c(x, y) = ǀx --- yǀ²/2. This question is shown to be equivalent to a double obstacle problem for the Monge-Amp{\`e}re equation, for which sufficient conditions are given to guarantee uniqueness of the solution, such as f vanishing on spt g in the quadratic case. The part of f to be transported increases monotonically with m, and if spt f and spt g are separated by a hyperplane H, then this part will be separated from the balance of f by a semiconcave Lipschitz graph over the hyperplane. If f = fχ Ω and g = gχ Λ are bounded away from zero and infinity on separated strictly convex domains Ω, Λ ⊂ R n , for the quadratic cost this graph is shown to be a $C_{\text{loc}}^{1,\alpha}$ hypersurface in Ω whose normal coincides with the direction transported; the optimal map between f and g is shown to be H{\"o}lder continuous up to this free boundary, and to those parts of the fixed boundary ∂Ω which map to locally convex parts of the path-connected target region.},
