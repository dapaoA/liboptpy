This paper applies dynamic screening framework on the $L_2$ penalized Unbalanced Optimal Transport (UOT) problem. Recently, researchers have linked the UOT problem to the Lasso problem, which encourages us to apply a technique that has been widely used in the Lasso problem, the Screening method, to the UOT problem. With the screening method, we can reasonably and safely freeze the unimportant elements of the sparse UOT solution, thus saving computational time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the screening method for the UOT. Benefiting from the unique structure of the UOT problem, our proposed improved algorithm substantially improves the screening efficiency compared to the Lasso algorithm without significantly increasing the computational complexity. We demonstrate the advantages of the algorithm through constructed experiments.
