	abstract = {Sparse optimization problems are ubiquitous in many fields such as statistics, signal/image processing and machine learning. This has led to the birth of many iterative algorithms to solve them. A powerful strategy to boost the performance of these algorithms is known as safe screening: it allows the early identification of zero coordinates in the solution, which can then be eliminated to reduce the problem's size and accelerate convergence. In this work, we extend the existing Gap Safe screening framework by relaxing the global strong-concavity assumption on the dual cost function. Instead, we exploit local regularity properties, that is, strong concavity on well-chosen subsets of the domain. The non-negativity constraint is also integrated to the existing framework. Besides making safe screening possible to a broader class of functions that includes β-divergences (e.g., the Kullback-Leibler divergence), the proposed approach also improves upon the existing Gap Safe screening rules on previously applicable cases (e.g., logistic regression). The proposed general framework is exemplified by some notable particular cases: logistic function, β = 1:5 and Kullback-Leibler divergences. Finally, we showcase the effectiveness of the proposed screening rules with different solvers (coordinate descent, multiplicative-update and proximal gradient algorithms) and different data sets (binary classification, hyperspectral and count data).},

@article{doi:10.1137/16M1106018,
	abstract = { Scaling algorithms for entropic transport-type problems have become a very popular numerical method, encompassing Wasserstein barycenters, multimarginal problems, gradient flows, and unbalanced transport. However, a standard implementation of the scaling algorithm has several numerical limitations: the scaling factors diverge and convergence becomes impractically slow as the entropy regularization approaches zero. Moreover, handling the dense kernel matrix becomes unfeasible for large problems. To address this, we combine several modifications: A log-domain stabilized formulation, the well-known \$\varepsilon\$-scaling heuristic, an adaptive truncation of the kernel, and a coarse-to-fine scheme. This permits the solution of larger problems with smaller regularization and negligible truncation error. A new convergence analysis of the Sinkhorn algorithm is developed, working toward a better understanding of \$\varepsilon\$-scaling. Numerical examples illustrate efficiency and versatility of the modified algorithm. },

	abstract = {We develop a full theory for the new class of Optimal Entropy-Transport problems between nonnegative and finite Radon measures in general topological spaces. These problems arise quite naturally by relaxing the marginal constraints typical of Optimal Transport problems: given a pair of finite measures (with possibly different total mass), one looks for minimizers of the sum of a linear transport functional and two convex entropy functionals, which quantify in some way the deviation of the marginals of the transport plan from the assigned measures. As a powerful application of this theory, we study the particular case of Logarithmic Entropy-Transport problems and introduce the new Hellinger--Kantorovich distance between measures in metric spaces. The striking connection between these two seemingly far topics allows for a deep analysis of the geometric properties of the new geodesic distance, which lies somehow between the well-known Hellinger--Kakutani and Kantorovich--Wasserstein distances.},

	abstract = {Summary
Understanding the molecular programs that guide differentiation during development is a major challenge. Here, we introduce Waddington-OT, an approach for studying developmental time courses to infer ancestor-descendant fates and model the regulatory programs that underlie them. We apply the method to reconstruct the landscape of reprogramming from 315,000 single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) profiles, collected at half-day intervals across 18 days. The results reveal a wider range of developmental programs than previously characterized. Cells gradually adopt either a terminal stromal state or a mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition state. The latter gives rise to populations related to pluripotent, extra-embryonic, and neural cells, with each harboring multiple finer subpopulations. The analysis predicts transcription factors and paracrine signals that affect fates and experiments validate that the TF Obox6 and the cytokine GDF9 enhance reprogramming efficiency. Our approach sheds light on the process and outcome of reprogramming and provides a framework applicable to diverse temporal processes in biology.},

	abstract = {Sequence-to-sequence models are commonly trained via maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). However, standard MLE training considers a word-level objective, predicting the next word given the previous ground-truth partial sentence. This procedure focuses on modeling local syntactic patterns, and may fail to capture long-range semantic structure. We present a novel solution to alleviate these issues. Our approach imposes global sequence-level guidance via new supervision based on optimal transport, enabling the overall characterization and preservation of semantic features. We further show that this method can be understood as a Wasserstein gradient flow trying to match our model to the ground truth sequence distribution. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the utility of the proposed approach, showing consistent improvements over a wide variety of NLP tasks, including machine translation, abstractive text summarization, and image captioning.},

	abstract = {Given compactly supported 0 ≤ f, g ∈ L¹(ℝ n ), the problem of transporting a fraction m ≤ min{∥ f ∥ L 1 , ∥ g ∥ L 1 } of the mass of f onto g as cheaply as possible is considered, where cost per unit mass transported is given by a cost function c, typically quadratic c(x, y) = ǀx --- yǀ²/2. This question is shown to be equivalent to a double obstacle problem for the Monge-Amp{\`e}re equation, for which sufficient conditions are given to guarantee uniqueness of the solution, such as f vanishing on spt g in the quadratic case. The part of f to be transported increases monotonically with m, and if spt f and spt g are separated by a hyperplane H, then this part will be separated from the balance of f by a semiconcave Lipschitz graph over the hyperplane. If f = fχ Ω and g = gχ Λ are bounded away from zero and infinity on separated strictly convex domains Ω, Λ ⊂ R n , for the quadratic cost this graph is shown to be a $C_{\text{loc}}^{1,\alpha}$ hypersurface in Ω whose normal coincides with the direction transported; the optimal map between f and g is shown to be H{\"o}lder continuous up to this free boundary, and to those parts of the fixed boundary ∂Ω which map to locally convex parts of the path-connected target region.},

	abstract = {Wasserstein distance plays increasingly important roles in machine learning, stochastic programming and image processing. Major efforts have been under way to address its high computational complexity, some leading to approximate or regularized variations such as Sinkhorn distance. However, as we will demonstrate, regularized variations with large regularization parameter will degradate the performance in several important machine learning applications, and small regularization parameter will fail due to numerical stability issues with existing algorithms. We address this challenge by developing an Inexact Proximal point method for exact Optimal Transport problem (IPOT) with the proximal operator approximately evaluated at each iteration using projections to the probability simplex. The algorithm (a) converges to exact Wasserstein distance with theoretical guarantee and robust regularization parameter selection, (b) alleviates numerical stability issue, (c) has similar computational complexity to Sinkhorn, and (d) avoids the shrinking problem when applies to generative models. Furthermore, a new algorithm is proposed based on IPOT to obtain sharper Wasserstein barycenter.},

These algorithms can separate the variables of a problem, avoid large matrix inversions, linearize a problem, restore symmetry, deal with equality and inequality constraints gracefully, and turn a nondifferentiable problem into a smooth problem. The author presents the first extended treatment of MM algorithms, which are ideal for high-dimensional optimization problems in data mining, imaging, and genomics; derives numerous algorithms from a broad diversity of application areas, with a particular emphasis on statistics, biology, and data mining; and summarizes a large amount of literature that has not reached book form before. Audience: This book is intended for those interested in high-dimensional optimization. Background material on convexity and semidifferentiable functions is derived in a setting congenial to graduate students.},
